# Why `purrr`?

Most of the `ggstatsplot` functions have `grouped_` variants, which are designed
to quickly run the same `ggstatsplot` function across multiple levels of a
**single** grouping variable. Although this function is useful for data
exploration, it has two strong weaknesses-

 * The arguments applied to `grouped_` function call are applied uniformly to
all levels of the grouping variable when we might want to customize them for
different levels of the grouping variable.

 * Only one grouping variable can be used to repeat the analysis when in reality
there can be a combination of grouping variables and the operation needs to be
repeated for all resulting combinations.

We will see how to overcome this limitation by combining `ggstatsplot` with the
`purrr` package. 

**Note: **

 * Unlike the typical function call for `ggstatsplot` functions where arguments
can be quoted (`"x"`) or unquoted (`x`), while using `purrr::pmap`, we **must**
*quote* the arguments.

 * You can use `ggplot2` themes from extension packages (like `ggthemes`).

 * If you'd like some more background or an introduction to the purrr package,
please see [this tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/).

# Introduction and methodology

For all the examples in this vignette we are going to build `list`s of things
that we will pass along to `purrr` which will in turn return a list of plots
that will be passed to `combine_plots`. As the name implies `combine_plots`
merges the individual plots into one bigger plot with common labeling and
aesthetics.

What are these `lists` that we are building? The lists correspond to the
parameters in our `ggstatsplot` function like `ggbetweenstats`. If you look at
the help file for `?ggbetweenstats` for example the very first parameter it
wants is the `data` file we'll be using. We can also pass it different `titles`
of even `ggtheme`s.

You can pass:

 * A single `chr` string such as `xlab = "Continent"` or numeric such as `nboot = 25` 
 in which case it will be reused/recycled as many times as needed.

 * A vector of values such as mean.label.size = c(3, 4, 5) in which case it will
be coerced to a list and checked for the right class (in this case `int`) and
the right quantity of entries in the vector i.e., mean.label.size = c(3, 4) will
fail if we're trying to make three plots.

 * A list; either named `data = year_list` or created as you go
`outlier.label.color = list("#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442")`. Any list will be
checked for the right class (in this case `chr`) and the right quantity of
entries in the list.

# `ggbetweenstats`

Following our methodology above let's start with `ggebtweenstats`. We'll use the
`gapminder` dataset. We'll make a 3 item named `list` called `data_list` using
`dplyr::filter` and `base::split`.

```{r purrr_ggbetweenstats1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7}
library(ggstatsplot)

# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# let's split the dataframe and create a list by years of interest
year_list <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    .data = .,
    year == 1967 |
      year == 1987 |
      year == 2007,
    continent != "Oceania"
  ) %>%
  base::split(x = ., f = .$year, drop = TRUE)

# this created a list with 3 elements, one for each year we want
# you can check the structure of the file for yourself
# str(year_list[1])

# checking the length of the list and the names of each element
length(year_list)
names(year_list)
```

Now that we have the data divided into the three relevant years in a list we'll
turn to `purrr::pmap` to create a list of ggplot objects that we'll make use of
stored in `plot_list`. When you look at the documentation for `?pmap` it will
accept `.l` which is a list of lists. The length of .l determines the number of
arguments that `.f` will be called with. List names will be used if present.
`.f` is the function we want to apply.  In our case `.f = ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats`.

So let's keep building `.l`.First is `data = year_list`, the x & y axes are constant in all three plots so we pass the variable name as a string `x = "continent"`. Same with the label we'll use for outliers where needed. For demonstration purposes let's assume we want the outliers on each plot to be a different color.  Not actually recommending it just demonstrating what's possible. We build a list on the fly with `outlier.label.color = list("#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442")`.  The rest of the code shows you a wide variety of possibilities and we won't catalog them here.

```{r purrr_ggbetweenstats2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7}
plot_list <- purrr::pmap(
  .l = list(
    data = year_list,
    x = "continent",
    y = "lifeExp",
    outlier.tagging = TRUE,
    outlier.label = "country",
    outlier.label.color = list(
      "#56B4E9",
      "#009E73",
      "#F0E442"
    ),
    xlab = "Continent",
    ylab = "Life expectancy",
    title = list(
      "Year: 1967",
      "Year: 1987",
      "Year: 2007"
    ),
    type = list("r", "bf", "np"),
    pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,
    pairwise.display = list("s", "ns", "all"),
    pairwise.annotation = list("asterisk", "asterisk", "p.value"),
    p.adjust.method = list("hommel", "bonferroni", "BH"),
    nboot = 25,
    conf.level = list(0.99, 0.95, 0.90),
    mean.label.size = c(3, 4, 5),
    k = list(1, 2, 3),
    effsize.type = list(
      NULL,
      "partial_omega",
      "partial_eta"
    ),
    plot.type = list("box", "boxviolin", "violin"),
    mean.ci = list(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
    package = list("nord", "ochRe", "awtools"),
    palette = list("aurora", "parliament", "ppalette"),
    ggtheme = list(
      ggthemes::theme_stata(),
      ggplot2::theme_classic(),
      ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
    ),
    ggstatsplot.layer = list(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
    sample.size.label = list(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
    messages = FALSE
  ),
  .f = ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats
)
```

The final step is to pass the `plot_list` object we just created to the
`combine_plots` function.  While each of the 3 plots already has labeling
information `combine_plots` gives us an opportunity to add additional details to
the merged plots and specify the layout in rows and columns.

```{r purrr_ggbetweenstats3, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 18, fig.width = 7}
# combining all individual plots from the list into a single plot using combine_plots function
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  plotlist = plot_list,
  title.text = "Changes in life expectancy across continents (1967-2007)",
  title.color = "red",
  nrow = 3,
  ncol = 1
)
```

# `ggscatterstats`

For the next example lets use the same methodology on different data and using
`ggscatterstats` to produce scatterplots combined with marginal
histograms/boxplots/density plots with statistical details added as a subtitle.

For data we'll use `movies_wide` which is from IMDB and part of the
`ggstatsplot` package. Since it's a large dataset with some relatively small
categories like **NC-17** we'll sample only one quarter of the data and
completely drop NC-17 using `dplyr`.  Once again we'll feed `purrr::pmap` a list
of lists via `.l` and for `.f` we'll specify `.f = ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats`.

This time we'll put all the code in one block...

```{r purrr_ggscatterstats, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 14, fig.width = 7}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

mpaa_list <- ggstatsplot::movies_wide %>%
  dplyr::filter(.data = ., mpaa != "NC-17") %>%
  dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ., size = 0.25) %>%
  base::split(x = ., f = .$mpaa, drop = TRUE)

plot_list <- purrr::pmap(
  .l = list(
    data = mpaa_list,
    x = "budget",
    y = "rating",
    xlab = "Budget (in millions of US dollars)",
    ylab = "Rating on IMDB",
    title = list(
      "MPAA Rating: PG",
      "MPAA Rating: PG-13",
      "MPAA Rating: R"
    ),
    label.var = list("title"),
    label.expression = list(
      "rating > 7.5 &
         budget < 100",
      "rating > 8 & budget < 50",
      "rating > 8 & budget < 10"
    ),
    type = list("r", "np", "bf"),
    method = list(MASS::rlm, "lm", "lm"),
    nboot = 25,
    marginal.type = list("boxplot", "density", "violin"),
    centrality.para = list("mean", "median", "mean"),
    xfill = list("#009E73", "#999999", "#0072B2"),
    yfill = list("#CC79A7", "#F0E442", "#D55E00"),
    ggtheme = list(
      ggthemes::theme_tufte(),
      ggplot2::theme_classic(),
      ggplot2::theme_light()
    ),
    ggstatsplot.layer = list(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
    messages = FALSE
  ),
  .f = ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats
)

# combining all individual plots from the list into a single plot using combine_plots function
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  plotlist = plot_list,
  title.text = "Relationship between movie budget and IMDB rating",
  caption.text = "Source: www.imdb.com",
  caption.size = 16,
  title.color = "red",
  caption.color = "blue",
  nrow = 3,
  ncol = 1,
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)", "(c)", "(d)")
)
```

The remainder of the examples vary in content but follow the exact same
methodology as the earlier examples.

# `grouped_` variants

Note that although all the above examples were written with the non-grouped
variants of functions, the same rule holds true for the `grouped_` variants of
all the above functions. 

For example, if we want to use the `grouped_gghistostats` across three different
datasets, you can use `purrr::pmap()` function. For the sake of brevity, the
plots are not displayed here, but you can run the following code and check the
individual `grouped_` plots (e.g., `plotlist[[1]]`).

```{r purrr_grouped, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# create a list of plots
plotlist <-
  purrr::pmap(
    .l = list(
      data = list(mtcars, iris, ToothGrowth),
      x = alist(wt, Sepal.Length, len),
      results.subtitle = list(FALSE),
      grouping.var = alist(am, Species, supp),
      title.text = list("Dataset: mtcars", "Dataset: iris", "Dataset: ToothGrowth"),
      messages = list(FALSE)
    ),
    .f = ggstatsplot::grouped_gghistostats
  )

# given that we had three different datasets, we expect a list of length 3
# (each of which contains a `grouped_` plot)
length(plotlist)
```
