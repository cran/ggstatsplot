The function `ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats` is meant to provide a
**publication-ready scatterplot** with all statistical details included in the
plot itself to show association between two continuous variables. This function
is also helpful during the **data exploration** phase. We will see examples of how
to use this function in this vignette with the `ggplot2movies` dataset.

To begin with, here are some instances where you would want to use
`ggscatterstats`-

  - to check linear association between two continuous variables
  - to check distribution of two continuous variables

**Note before**: The following demo uses the pipe operator (`%>%`), so in case
you are not familiar with this operator, here is a good explanation:
<http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html>

## Correlation plot with `ggscatterstats`

To illustrate how this function can be used, we will rely on the `ggplot2movies`
dataset. This dataset provides information about movies scraped from
[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). Specifically, we will be using cleaned version of
this dataset included in the `ggstatsplot` package itself.

```{r ggplot2movies1}
library(ggstatsplot)

# see the selected data (we have data from 1813 movies)
dplyr::glimpse(x = ggstatsplot::movies_wide)
```

Now that we have a clean dataset, we can start asking some interesting
questions. For example, let's see if the average IMDB rating for a movie has any
relationship to its budget. Additionally, let's also see which movies had a high
budget but low IMDB rating by labeling those data points. 

To reduce the processing time, let's only work with 30% of the dataset.

```{r ggscatterstats1,  fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = movies_long, size = 0.1)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(
  data = movies_10, # dataframe from which variables are taken
  x = budget, # predictor/independent variable
  y = rating, # dependent variable
  xlab = "Budget (in millions of US dollars)", # label for the x-axis
  ylab = "Rating on IMDB", # label for the y-axis
  label.var = title, # variable to use for labeling data points
  label.expression = rating < 5 & budget > 75, # expression for deciding which points to label
  point.label.args = list(alpha = 0.7, size = 4, color = "grey50"),
  marginal.type = "density", # type of plot for marginal distribution
  xfill = "#CC79A7", # fill for marginals on the x-axis
  yfill = "#009E73", # fill for marginals on the y-axis
  title = "Relationship between movie budget and IMDB rating",
  caption = "Source: www.imdb.com"
)
```

There is indeed a small, but significant, positive correlation between the
amount of money studio invests in a movie and the ratings given by the
audiences.

**Important**: 

In contrast to all other functions in this package, the `ggscatterstats`
function returns object that is **not** further modifiable with `ggplot2`. This
can be avoided by not plotting the marginal distributions (`marginal = FALSE`).
Currently trying to find a workaround this problem.

## Grouped analysis with `grouped_ggscatterstats`

What if we want to do the same analysis do the same analysis for movies with
different MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) film ratings (NC-17, PG,
PG-13, R)? 

`ggstatsplot` provides a special helper function for such instances:
`grouped_ggstatsplot`. This is merely a wrapper function around
`ggstatsplot::combine_plots`. It applies `ggstatsplot` across all **levels** of
a specified **grouping variable** and then combines list of individual plots
into a single plot. Note that the grouping variable can be anything: conditions
in a given study, groups in a study sample, different studies, etc. 

Let's see how we can use this function to apply `ggscatterstats` for all MPAA
ratings. Also, let's run a robust test this time.

```{r grouped1, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 7}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 20% of the data
# also since there are only 7 movies with NC-17 ratings, leave them out
movies_20 <-
  ggstatsplot::movies_wide %>%
  dplyr::filter(.data = ., mpaa != "NC-17") %>%
  dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ., size = 0.2)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggscatterstats(
  # arguments relevant for ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats
  data = movies_10,
  x = budget,
  y = rating,
  type = "r",
  grouping.var = mpaa,
  label.var = title,
  label.expression = rating < 5 & budget < 20,
  marginal.type = "boxplot",
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_tufte(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  # arguments relevant for ggstatsplot::combine_plots
  annotation.args = list(
    title = "Relationship between movie budget and IMDB rating",
    caption = "Source: www.imdb.com"
  ),
  plotgrid.args = list(nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
)
```

As seen from the plot, this analysis has revealed something interesting: The
relationship we found between budget and IMDB rating holds only for PG-13 and
R-rated movies. 

## Grouped analysis with `ggscatterstats` + `purrr`

Although this is a quick and dirty way to explore large amount of data with
minimal effort, it does come with an important limitation: reduced flexibility.
For example, if we wanted to add, let's say, a separate type of marginal
distribution plot for each MPAA rating or if we wanted to use different types of
correlations across different levels of MPAA ratings (NC-17 has only 6 movies,
so a robust correlation would be a good idea), this is not possible. But this
can be easily done using `purrr`.

## Summary of tests

Following tests are carried out for each type of analyses. Additionally, the
correlation coefficients (and their confidence intervals) are used as effect
sizes-

Type | Test | CI? | Function
----------- | ------------------------- | --- | -----
Parametric | Pearson's correlation coefficient | <font color="green">Yes<font> | `correlation::correlation`
Non-parametric | Spearman's rank correlation coefficient | <font color="green">Yes<font> | `correlation::correlation`
Robust | Winsorized Pearson correlation coefficient | <font color="green">Yes<font> | `correlation::correlation`
Bayes Factor | Pearson's correlation coefficient | <font color="green">Yes</font> | `correlation::correlation`
