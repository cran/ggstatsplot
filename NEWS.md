# ggstatsplot 0.0.6

MAJOR CHANGES
  - The package now exports all functions used to create text expressions with
  results. This makes it easy for people to use these results in their own plots
  at any location they want (and not just in `subtitle`, the current default for
  `ggstatsplot`).
  - `ggcorrmat` gains `p.adjust.method` argument which allows *p*-values for
  correlations to be corrected for multiple comparisons.
  - `ggscatterstats` gains `label.var` and `label.expression` arguments to
  attach labels to points.
  - `gghistostats` now defaults to not showing (redundant) color gradient
  (`fill.gradient = FALSE`) and shows both `"count"` and `"proportion"` data. It
  also gains a new argument `bar.fill` that can be used to fill bars with a
  uniform color.
  - `ggbetweenstats`,  `ggcoefstats`, `ggcorrmat`, `ggscatterstats`, and
  `ggpiestats` now support all palettes contained in the `paletteer` package.
  This helps avoid situations where people had large number of groups (> 12) and
  there were not enough colors in any of the `RColorBrewer` palettes.
  - `ggbetweenstats` gains `bf.message` argument to display bayes factors in
  favor of the null (currently works only for parametric t-test).
  - `gghistostats` function no longer has `line.labeller.y` argument; this
  position is automatically determined now.

BREAKING CHANGES
  - `legend.title.margin` function has been depcrecated since `ggplot2 3.0.0` has
  improved on the margin issues from previous versions. All functions that
  wrapped around this function now lose the relevant arguments
  (`legend.title.margin`, `t.margin`, `b.margin`).
  - The argument `ggstatsplot.theme` has been changed to `ggstatsplot.layer` for
  `ggcorrmat` function to be consistent across functions.
  - For consistency, `conf.level` and `conf.type` arguments for `ggbetweenstats`
  have been deprecated. No other function in the package allowed changing
  confidence interval or their type for effect size estimation. These arguments
  were relevant only for `robust` tests anyway.
  - `ggocorrmat` argument `type` has been changed to `matrix.type` because for
  all other functions `type` argument specifies the type of the test, while for
  this function it specified the display of the virsualization matrix. This will
  make the syntax more consistent across functions.
  - `ggscatterstats` gains new arguments to specify aesthetics for geom point
  (`point.color`, `point.size`, `point.alpha`). To be consistent with this
  naming schema, the `width.jitter` and `height.jitter` arguments have been
  renamed to `point.width.jitter` and `point.height.jitter`, resp.

MINOR CHANGES
  - `gghistostats`: To be compatible with `JASP`, natural logarithm of Bayes
  Factors is displayed, and not base 10 logarithm.
  - `ggscatterstats` gains `method` and `formula` arguments to modify smoothing
  functions.
  - `ggcorrmat` can now show `robust` correlation coefficients in the matrix
  plot.
  - For `gghistostats`, `binwidth` value, if not specified, is computed with
  `(max-min)/sqrt(n)`. This is basically to get rid of the warnings ggplot2
  produces. Thanks to Chuck Powell's PR (#43).
  - `ggcoefstats` gains a new argument `partial` and can display eta-squared and
  omega-squared effect sizes for anovas, in addition to the prior partial
  variants of these effect sizes.
  - `ggpiestats` gains `perc.k` argument to show desired number of decimal
  places in percentage labels.

BUG FIXES
  - `grouped_ggpiestats` wasn't working when only `main` variable was provided
  with `counts` data. Fixed that.
  
# ggstatsplot 0.0.5

MAJOR CHANGES
  - For the sake of consistency, `theme_mprl` is now called `theme_ggstatsplot`.
    The `theme_mprl` function will still be around and will **not** be deprecated,
    so feel free to use either or both of them since they are identical.
  - `ggcoefstats` no longer has arguments `effects` and `ran_params` because
    only fixed effects are shown for mixed-effects models.
  - `ggpiestats` can now handle within-subjects designs (McNemar test results
  will be displayed).
     
BUG FIXES
  - `ggbetweenstats` was producing wrong axes labels when `sample.size.label`
    was set to `TRUE` and user had reordered factor levels before using this
    function. The new version fixes this.
  - `ggcoefstats` wasn't producing partial omega-squared for `aovlist` objects.
    Fixed that with new version of `sjstats`.

MINOR CHANGES
  - Removed the trailing comma from the robust correlation analyses.
  - `gghistostats` has a new argument to remove color fill gradient.
  - `ggbetweenstats` takes new argument `mean.ci` to show confidence intervals
    for the mean values.
  - For `lmer` models, p-values are now computed using `sjstats::p_value`. This
    removes `lmerTest` package from dependencies.
  - `sjstats` no longer suggests `apaTables` package to compute confidence
    intervals for partial eta- and omega-squared. Therefore, `apaTables` and
    `MBESS` are removed from dependencies.
  - `ggscatterstats` supports `densigram` with the development version of
    `ggExtra`. It additionally gains few extra arguments to change aesthetics of
    marginals (alpha, size, etc.).

# ggstatsplot 0.0.4

MAJOR CHANGES

  - New function: `ggcoefstats` for displaying model coefficients.
  - All functions now have `ggtheme` argument that can be used to change the
    default theme, which has now been changed from `theme_grey()` to
    `theme_bw()`.
  - The robust correlation is no longer `MASS::rlm`, but percentage bend
    correlation, as implemented in `WRS2::pbcor`. This was done to be consistent
    across different functions. `ggcorrmat` also uses percentage bend
    correlation as the robust correlation measure. This also means that
    `ggstatsplot` no longer imports `MASS` and `sfsmisc`.
  - The `data` argument is no longer `NULL` for all functions, except
    `gghistostats`. In other words, the user **must** provide a dataframe from
    which variables or formulas should be selected.
  - All subtitles containing results now also show sample size information
    (*n*). To adjust for the inflated length of the subtitle, the default
    subtitle text size has been changed from `12` to `11`.

MINOR CHANGES

  - Switched back to Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to remove `nortest` from
    imports.
  - `ggpiestats` can now handle dataframes with 
  - `ggbetweenstats` and `ggpiestats` now display sample sizes for each level of
    the groping factor by default. This behavior can be turned off by setting
    `sample.size.label` to `FALSE`.
  - Three new datasets added: `Titanic_full`, `movies_wide`, `movies_long`. 
  - Added confidence interval for effect size for robust ANOVA. 
  - The 95% CI for Cramer'V computed using `boot::boot`. Therefore,
    the package no longer imports `DescTools`. 
  - To be consistent across correlations covered, all correlations now show
    estimates for correlation coefficients, confidence intervals for the estimate,
    and *p*-values. Therefore, *t*-values and regression coefficients are no
    longer displayed for Pearson's *r*.
  - The `legend.title.margin` arguments for `gghistostats` and `ggcorrmat` now
    default to `FALSE`, since `ggplot2 3.0.0` has better legend title margins.
  - `ggpiestats` now sorts the summary dataframes not by percentages but by the
    levels of `main` variable. This was done to have the same legends across
    different levels of a grouping variable in `grouped_ggpiestats`.
  - To remove cluttered display of results in the subtitle, `ggpiestats` no
    longer shows titles for the tests run (these were "Proportion test" and
    "Chi-Square test"). From the pie charts, it should be obvious to the user or
    reader what test was run.
  - `gghistostats` also allows running robust version of one-sample test now
    (One-sample percentile bootstrap).

# ggstatsplot 0.0.3

NEW FEATURES

  - The `ggbetweenstats` function can now show notched box plots. Two new
    arguments `notch` and `notchwidth` control its behavior. The defaults are
    still standard box plots.
  - Removed warnings that were appearing when `outlier.label` argument was of
    `character` type.
  - The default color palette used for all plots is colorblind friendly.
  - `gghistostats` supports `proportion` and `density` as a value measure for
    bar heights to show proportions and density. New argument `bar.measure`
    controls this behavior.
  - `grouped_` variants of functions `ggcorrmat`, `ggscatterstats`,
    `ggbetweenstats`, and `ggpiestats` introduced to create multiple plots for
    different levels of a grouping variable.

MAJOR CHANGES
  - To be internally consistent, all functions in `ggstatsplot` use the spelling
    `color`, rather than `colour` in some functions, while `color` in others.
  - Removed the redundant argument `binwidth.adjust` from `gghistostats`
    function. This argument was relevant for the first avatar of this fucntion,
    but is no longer playing any role.
  - To be internally consistent, the argument `lab_col` and `lab_size` in
    `ggcorrmat` have been changed to `lab.col` and `lab.size`, respectively.

MINOR CHANGES

  - Added a new argument to `ggstatsplot.theme` function to control if
    `ggstatsplot::theme_mprl` is to be overlaid on top of the selected ggtheme
    (ggplot2 theme, i.e.).
  - Two new arguments added to `gghistostats` to allow user to change colorbar
    gradient. Defaults are colorblind friendly.
  - Both `gghistostats` and `ggcorrmat` have a new argument
    `legend.title.margin` to control margin adjustment between the title and the
    colorbar.
  - The vertical lines denoting test values and centrality parameters can be
    tagged with text labels with a new argument `line.labeller` in
    `gghistostats` function.

BUG FIXES

  - The `centrality.para` argument for `ggscatterstats` was not working
    properly. Choosing `"median"` didn't show median, but the mean. This is
    fixed now.
    
# ggstatsplot 0.0.2

NEW FEATURES

  - Bayesian test added to `gghistostats` and two new arguments to also display
    a vertical line for `test.value` argument.
  - Vignette added for `gghistostats`.
  - Added new function `grouped_gghistostats` to facilitate applying
    `gghistostats` for multiple levels of a grouping factor.
  - `ggbetweenstats` has a new argument `outlier.coef` to adjust threshold used
    to detect outliers. Removed bug from the same function when `outlier.label`
    argument is of factor/character type.

MAJOR CHANGES

  - Functions `signif_column` and `grouped_proptest` are now deprecated. They
    were exported in the first release by mistake.
  - Function `gghistostats` no longer displays both density and count since the
    density information was redundant. The `density.plot` argument has also been
    deprecated.
  - `ggscatterstats` argument `intercept` has now been changed to
    `centrality.para`. This was due to possible confusion about interpreation of
    these lines; they show central tendency measures and not intercept for the
    linear model. Thus the change.
  - The default for `effsize.type = "biased"` effect size for `ggbetweenstats`
    in case of ANOVA is **partial** omega-squared, and not omega-squared.
    Additionally, both partial eta- and omega-squared are not computed using
    bootstrapping with (default) 100 bootstrap samples.
    
MINOR CHANGES

  - More examples added to the `README` document.
  - 95% confidence intervals for Spearman's rho are now computed using `broom`
    package. `RVAideMemoire` package is thus removed from dependencies.
  - 95% confidence intervals for partial eta- and omega-squared for
    `ggbetweenstats` function are now computed using `sjstats` package, which
    allows bootstrapping. `apaTables` and `userfriendlyscience` packages are
    thus removed from dependencies.

# ggstatsplot 0.0.1

- First release of the package.
