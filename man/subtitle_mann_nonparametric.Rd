\title{Making text subtitle for the Mann-Whitney \emph{U}-test
(between-subjects designs).}
\usage{
subtitle_mann_nonparametric(data, x, y, paired = FALSE, k = 2,
  conf.level = 0.95, messages = TRUE, ...)

subtitle_t_nonparametric(data, x, y, paired = FALSE, k = 2,
  conf.level = 0.95, messages = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe (or a tibble) from which variables specified are to
be taken. A matrix or tables will \strong{not} be accepted.}

\item{x}{The grouping variable from the dataframe \code{data}.}

\item{y}{The response (a.k.a. outcome or dependent) variable from the
dataframe \code{data}.}

\item{paired}{a logical indicating whether you want a paired
    t-test.}

\item{k}{Number of digits after decimal point (should be an integer)
(Default: \code{k = 2}).}

\item{conf.level}{Scalar between 0 and 1. If unspecified, the defaults return
\code{95\%} lower and upper confidence intervals (\code{0.95}).}

\item{messages}{Decides whether messages references, notes, and warnings are
to be displayed (Default: \code{TRUE}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\description{
Making text subtitle for the Mann-Whitney \emph{U}-test
(between-subjects designs).
}
\details{
Two-sample Wilcoxon test, also known as Mann-Whitney test, is
carried out. The effect size estimate for this test is Spearman's \emph{rho}
as the ranks of the \code{y} variable related to the factor \code{x}.

For the two independent samples case, the Mann Whitney \emph{U}-test
is calculated and \emph{W} is reported from \emph{stats::wilcox.test}. For the
paired samples case the Wilcoxon signed rank test is run and \emph{V} is
reported.

Since there is no single commonly accepted method for reporting effect size
for these tests we are computing and reporting Spearman's \emph{rho} a.k.a. \emph{r}
along with the confidence intervals associated with the estimate.

We have selected \emph{Spearman's rho} which should be nearly identical to rank
bi-serial and Somer's \emph{d} for the case of x as two factors (including) as a
pre/post measure and with \emph{y} treated as ranks rather than raw scores.
